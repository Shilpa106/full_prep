#1 Reverse words in a given string
# Input: s = “geeks quiz practice code” 
# Output: s = “code practice quiz geeks”


# 2
# Given an array of strings : { “Sdjksajd”, “Skjdasjj”, “Bjsdakja”, “Xhudhau”, “Eeeeggg”, “Chrome”}.
#  Display them in alphabetical order without using library functions .
# O/P:- “Bjsdakja_Chrome_Eeeeggg_Sdjksajd_Skjdasjj_Xhudhau“.


# 3Josephus Problem



#4 Given a string “XYZ” .Print all permutations in sorted lexicographic order.

1. Program to find largest of three number.(5 Marks)
2. Program to find HCF of two number.(15)
3. Program to find reverse of input string in this pattern I/P.: Hello_World O/P.: olleH_dlroW(20)
4. Program to merge two strings like I/P: Strings, Hello O/P: SHterlilnogs(30)
5. String based question(45)


Round 1(coding): They asked Five questions:

Simple cube of a number?5marks
String like str1= “This_is_my_car”  what is the frequency of str2=”is” ?
Time given input- 08:30 AM mirror the time
don’t remember
Given string str1=”AABBABBBSBSABABEABCABCAB” find the no of frequency of str2= “ABC” the str2 should be like AB BC or ABC no matter but 2 letters must be present
Round 2(Technical):

1. Design database and perform join query like tables project, client, employee.

2.sql query like max salary, 2nd max salary, 3rd max salary

3. object-oriented programming in depth

4. About project

Round 3(Technical):

Again data structure and algorithm questions
some coding questions from string
SQL query
