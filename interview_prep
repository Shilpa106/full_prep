# You are given a string s and an array of string words of the same length. Return all starting indices of		 substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once, in any order, and without any intervening characters.

# You can return the answer in any order.


# Example 1:

# Input: s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]

# Output: [0,9]

# Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively. The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.


# Example 2:

# Input: s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", words = ["word","good","best","word"]

# Output: []


# Example 3:

# Input: s = "barfoofoobarthefoobarman", words = ["bar","foo","the"]

# Output: [6,9,12]


# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 104

# s consists of lower-case English letters.

# 1 <= words.length <= 5000

# 1 <= words[i].length <= 30

# words[i] consists of lower-case English letters.
