# Difficulty Level : Medium
# Last Updated : 11 Jun, 2022
# Given a binary matrix whose elements are only 0 and 1, we need to print the rows which are duplicate of rows which are already present in the matrix.
# Examples: 
 

# Input : {1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1},
#     {0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1},
#     {1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0},
#     {1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1},
#     {0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1},
#     {0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1}.

# Output :
# There is a duplicate row at position: 4 
# There is a duplicate row at position: 5 
# There is a duplicate row at position: 6
