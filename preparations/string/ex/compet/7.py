# Given a list, the task is to write a Python program to mark the duplicate occurrence of elements with progressive occurrence number.

# Input : test_list = [‘gfg’, ‘is’, ‘best’, ‘gfg’, ‘best’, ‘for’, ‘all’, ‘gfg’]

# Output : [‘gfg1’, ‘is’, ‘best1’, ‘gfg2’, ‘best2’, ‘for’, ‘all’, ‘gfg3’]

# Explanation : gfg’s all occurrence are marked as it have multiple repetitions(3).

# Input : test_list = [‘gfg’, ‘is’, ‘best’, ‘best’, ‘for’, ‘all’]
