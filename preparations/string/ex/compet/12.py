# Python | Sorting string using order defined by another string

# Last Updated : 11 May, 2020

# Given two strings (of lowercase letters), a pattern and a string. The task is to sort string according to the order defined by pattern and return the reverse of it. It may be assumed that pattern has all characters of the string and all characters in pattern appear only once.

# Examples:

# Input : pat = "asbcklfdmegnot", str = "eksge" 
# Output : str = "geeks"
# (after sorting, str becomes "skeeg" and return its reverse)

# Input : pat = "mgewqnasibkldjxruohypzcftv", str = "niocgd"
# Output : str = "coding"
