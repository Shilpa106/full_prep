# You have write a function that accepts, a string which length is “len”, the string has some “#”, in it you have to move all the hashes to the front of
#  the string and return the whole string back and print it.

# example :-

# Sample Test Case

# Input:

#            Move#Hash#to#Front

# Output:

#          ###MoveHashtoFront

# str='Move#Hash#to#Front'
# print(str)
# c=str.count('#')
# print(c)
# st=str.replace('#','')
# # print(# +str)
# print(c*'#'+st)



# Capgemini in its online written test have a coding question, wherein the students are given a string with multiple characters that are repeated consecutively. You’re supposed to reduce the size of this string using mathematical logic given as in the example below :

# Input :

# aabbbbeeeeffggg

# Output:

# a2b4e4f2g3

# Input :

# abbccccc

# Output:

# ab2c5


# Write the code to traverse a matrix in a spiral format.

 

# Sample Input 

# Input 

# 5   4


# 1   2   3   4

# 5   6   7   8

# 9   10 11 12

# 13 14 15 16

# 17 18 19 20

# Output 

# 1  2  3  4  8  12  16  20  19  18  17  13  9  5  6  7  11  15  12  14 10  

# 11,12,13,14,24,34,44,54,53,52,51,41,31,21,22,23,33,43,42,32

# You’re given an array of integers, print the number of times each integer has occurred in the array.

 

# Example

# Input :

# 10

# 1 2 3 3 4 1 4 5 1 2

 

# Output :

# 1 occurs 3 times

# 2 occurs 2 times

# 3 occurs 2 times

# 4 occurs 2 times

# 5 occurs 1 times

# Write a function to solve the following equation a3 + a2b + 2a2b + 2ab2 + ab2 + b3.



# # 6
# A function is there which tells how many dealerships there are and the total number of cars in each dealership.

# Your job is to calculate how many tyres would be there in each dealership.

 

# Input

# 3 

# 4 2

# 4 0

# 1 2

# Output

# 20

# 16

# 8

 

# There are total 3 dealerships

# dealerships1 contains 4 cars and 2 bikes

# dealerships2 contains 4 cars and 0 bikes

# dealerships3 contains 1 cars and 2 bikes

# Total number of tyres in dealerships1  is (4 x 4) + (2 x 2) = 20

# Total number of tyres in dealerships2 is (4 x 4) + (0 x 2) = 16

# Total number of tyres in dealerships3 is (1 x 4) + (2 x 2) = 8
