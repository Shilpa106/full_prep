# Given a Binary Matrix. The task is to find the pair of row in the Binary matrix that has maximum bit difference

# Examples:

# Input: mat[][] = {{1, 1, 1, 1},
#                  {1, 1, 0, 1},
#                  {0, 0, 0, 0}};
# Output : (1, 3)
# Bit difference between row numbers 1 and 3
# is maximum with value 4. Bit difference 
# between 1 and 2 is 1 and between 2 and 3
# is 3.

# Input: mat[][] = {{1 ,1 ,1 ,1 }
#                   {1 ,0, 1 ,1 }
#                   {0 ,1 ,0 ,0 }
#                   {0, 0 ,0 ,0 }} 
# Output : (2, 3)
# Bit difference between rows 2 and 3 is 
# maximum which is 4.

# Input: mat[][] = {{1 ,0 ,1 ,1 }
#                   {1 ,1 ,1 ,1 }
#                   {0 ,1 ,0 ,1 }
#                   {1, 0 ,0 ,0 }} 
# Output : (1, 3) or (2  ,4 ) or (3 ,4 ) 
# They all are having  maximum bit difference
# that is 3
