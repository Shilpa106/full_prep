# Python Counter| Find duplicate rows in a binary matrix

# Last Updated : 30 Dec, 2020
# Given a binary matrix whose elements are only 0 and 1, we need to print the rows which are duplicate of rows which are already present in the matrix.

# Examples:

# Input : [[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
#          [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
#          [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
#          [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
#          [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
#          [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]]

# Output : (1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1)
#          (0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1)
