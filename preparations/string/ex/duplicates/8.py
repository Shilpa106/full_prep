#  To Recursively Remove All Adjacent Duplicates

# Last Updated : 23 Dec, 2021
# Given a string, recursively remove adjacent duplicate characters from the string. The output string should not have any adjacent duplicates. See the following examples.

# Examples: 

# Input: azxxzy 
# Output: ay 
# First “azxxzy” is reduced to “azzy”. 
# The string “azzy” contains duplicates, 
# so it is further reduced to “ay”.

# Input: geeksforgeeg 
# Output: gksfor 
# First “geeksforgeeg” is reduced to 
# “gksforgg”. The string “gksforgg” 
# contains duplicates, so it is further 
# reduced to “gksfor”.

# Input: caaabbbaacdddd 
# Output: Empty String

# Input: acaaabbbacdddd 
# Output: acac
