# Sum of the shortest distance between all 0s to 1 in given binary string

# Last Updated : 24 Sep, 2021
# Given a binary string S, the task is to find the sum of the shortest distance between all 0s to 1 in the given string S.

# Examples:

# Input: S = “100100” 
# Output: 5
# Explanation: 
# For the ‘0’ at index 1 the nearest ‘1’ is at index 0 at a distance 1.
# For the ‘0’ at index 2 the nearest ‘1’ is at index 3 at a distance 1.
# For the ‘0’ at index 4 the nearest ‘1’ is at index 3 at a distance 1.
# For the ‘0’ at index 5 the nearest ‘1’ is at index 3 at a distance 2.
# Therefore the sum of the distances is  1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5.

# Input: S = “1111”
# Output: 0
