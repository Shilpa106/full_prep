# Given two equal length chords of a circle and Distance between the centre and one chord. The task is here to find the distance between the centre and the other chord. 
# Examples: 
 

# Input: 48
# Output: 48


# Input: 82
# Output: 82
 



# Below is the implementation of the above approach:
# Approach: 
# Let AB & CD be the two equal chords of the circle having center at O.OM be the given distance of the chord AB from center. 
# now in triangle AOM and CON, 
# OA = OC (radii of same circle) 
# MA = CN (since OM and ON are the perpendicular to the chord and it bisects the chord and AM = MB & CN = CD) 
# angle AMO = angle ONC = 90 degrees 
# so the triangles are congruent 
# so, OM = ON
 

# Equal chords of a circle are equidistant from the centre of a circle.
