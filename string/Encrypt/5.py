Given a string, task is to write a function translate() that will translate a text into “rovarspraket” (Swedish for “robber’s language”). That is, double every consonant and place an occurrence of “o” in between.

t is consonant then double the consonant and place "o" in between, 
So it becomes "tot" and do this for full string
