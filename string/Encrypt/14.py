# Given a weighted undirected connected graph with N nodes and M edges. Some of the nodes are marked as good. The task is to find the shortest distance between any pair of two different good nodes.
# Note: Nodes marked as yellow in the below examples are considered to be good nodes.

# Examples:  

# Input :


# Output : 7
# Explanation : 
# Pairs of Good Nodes and distance between them are:
# (1 to 3) -> distance: 7, 
# (3 to 5) -> distance: 9, 
# (1 to 5) -> distance: 16, 
# out of which 7 is the minimum.

# Input :


# Output : 4
