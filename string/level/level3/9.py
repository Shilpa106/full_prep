# Given a string S consisting of opening and closing parenthesis '(' and ')'. Find length of the longest valid parenthesis substring.

# A parenthesis string is valid if:

# For every opening parenthesis, there is a closing parenthesis.
# Opening parenthesis must be closed in the correct order.
# Example 1:

# Input: S = ((()
# Output: 2
# Explaination: The longest valid 
# parenthesis substring is "()".
# Example 2:

# Input: S = )()())
# Output: 4
# Explaination: The longest valid 
# parenthesis substring is "()()".
# Your Task:
# You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function maxLength() which takes string S as input parameter and returns the length of the maximum valid parenthesis substring.

# Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|)
# Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|)

# Constraints:
# 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 105
